## Logic
Logic was created in a chain of SCADA experiments and powers multiple ai networks including KiraAI suite of ai. When an ai is powered by logic, it is un-bias and will work for you.
LS-DOS (Light Standard Logic Disk Operating System) is my own creation, and supports unix and dos functions and features. You can power your ai or SyLink with logic 120 or 130, find what works for you.
Yes, this is a real cogative enhancement / quality of life improvement system that you can run in your cmd or terminal that actually works.
